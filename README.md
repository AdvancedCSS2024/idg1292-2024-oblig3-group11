     ## Project overview and purpose.
     For this project we wanted to shead light on how frogs are indicator species for a good environment, and what that entails.
     Showing how frogs are sensitive to their environment is supposed to show a different side to the effects of pollution, where the
     affected are the frogs we all know and love.

     This is connected to the Sustainability Goal 15; Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss.

     ## Points discussed during the braimstorming session.
     Discussed if we should include other species that also ar indicators and helpers for the environment.

     ## Docunentation about the Storyboard created before implementing the website.
     Pictures from our brainstorming session and our storyboard sketches.
